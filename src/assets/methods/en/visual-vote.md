### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The Visual Vote is a quick and easy way to prioritize ideas. All members of a group are involved when it comes to making a choice and preparing decisions.
By applying dots for individual aspects or suggestions, a visual trend is created within a few minutes.

### Added value

This type of vote can be used universally and extended as desired: for single-color variants, the quantity determines the color; for multi-color variants, the colors are important, too. By placing colored dots or elements, each person can vote individually on the importance of multiple aspects that require prioritization.
