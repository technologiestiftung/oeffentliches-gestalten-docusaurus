### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Potential Construction Kit** promotes differentiated further processing of needs and obstacles. By distinguishing between different insight levels it is possible to identify systemic patterns and areas of potential for innovation.

### Added value

The analysis of desirable states and hindering factors opens up perspectives that otherwise remain implicit. Once the structural level becomes clear, it is possible to derive useful principles. These can indicate potential for change, which can in turn serve as the key to a solution.
