### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Team Profile** can be used to assemble a strong and balanced group that combines all the necessary competencies for effective design work. Here, career stages in a resume and certified skills count for just as much as personal experience and a sense of humor.

### Added value

**Self-Assessment** is used to determine which role is right for each team member. This honest reflection provides a good starting point for restructuring familiar patterns of collaboration and consciously embarking on the journey together.
