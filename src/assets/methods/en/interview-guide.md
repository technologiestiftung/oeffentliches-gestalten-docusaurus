### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Unlike a quantitative survey, the planned interview does not follow a rigid sequence of questions. The use of open-ended and in-depth questions forms the basis for our semi-structured interview. The **Interview Guide** can and should be adapted according to the situation. This gives us the flexibility to let our inter- view partner talk freely and allows us to ask specific questions about interesting aspects.

### Added value

In addition to the predefined topic areas, the guide leaves enough room to accommodate new points that arise during the interview. In this way, we can remain open to discovering new things while still keeping our focus on what it is we want to find out. We get better at this the more interviews we conduct.
