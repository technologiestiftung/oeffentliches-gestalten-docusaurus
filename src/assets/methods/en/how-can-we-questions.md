note: "How Can We ... questions can be regarded as a form of solution-oriented thinking. By starting the sentence in this way, it is possible to articulate challenges constructively and work on them with a focus on the matter at hand. They’re usually applied to the formulation of a guiding problem hypothesis. But they can in fact be used at different points in the innovation process: as a leading question before contact with key actors, for example, or as a provocation to develop particularly crazy ideas."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

_“How Can We...” Questions_ cluster insights gained
by meaningfully combining desirable states and hindering factors in an open-ended question. With their simple and flexible structure, they point in the direction of possible solutions but without prescribing them.

### Added value

**HCW questions** strengthen individual and collective problem-solving skills. Their challenging nature stimulates the development of multiple, less obvious ideas that are targeted towards a common goal.
