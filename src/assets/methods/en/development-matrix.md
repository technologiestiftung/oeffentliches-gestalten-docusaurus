### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Development Matrix** clarifies the current situation and enables necessary developments to be recorded. A bird’s eye view of the topic is taken so as to determine whether an innovation or the removal of a routine that is no longer needed will bring about the desired outcome.

### Added value

This matrix is universally applicable. It shows simultaneously in different dimensions which activities can be used to initiate effective change. The product is a living document that provides the necessary orientation and basis for evaluation **as the process moves forward**.
