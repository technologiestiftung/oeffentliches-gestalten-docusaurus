### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Areas of potential show as yet unexploited opportunities for the development of innovative solutions. Based on the outcomes to date, areas of potential are created that guide us towards recommendations and measures that can be implemented right away.

### Added value

By describing areas of potential, we conclude our field investigation in an evidence-based manner. The depth, interest, and richness in the insights developed are engagingly conveyed in summarized form. The compilation of diverse knowledge allows the core team to make a strong case for outcomes based on encounters with key actors.
