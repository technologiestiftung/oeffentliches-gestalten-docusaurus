note: "The structure of the test situation is based on participatory observations. The advantage of this method is that it creates an investigation situation that is close to the day-to-day life of the user. Truly authentic insights can be gained by uncovering routine patterns of behavior that often occur unconsciously."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The test procedure describes the stages of the test situation over a defined period of time (e.g. 45 min). Detailed planning of important interaction points with the test subjects promotes the implementation of a methodically guided test run, combining dramaturgy and content with roles and attitudes.

### Added value

Acting out the test situation focuses on strengthening effective interaction in the team, enabling an optimum test experience for those involved. By adapting the stimulus questions, specific assumptions relating to the solution can be assessed and adapted.
