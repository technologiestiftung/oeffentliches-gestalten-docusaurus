### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Public innovation aims to solve complex problems and improve systems. But changes of this kind can only be brought about for and with the people who are active in the setting concerned. Mapping out the relevant actors identifies those groups of people who are impacted by the effects or responsible for the causes.

### Added value

The actors unconsciously or consciously influence the situation due to their different roles and interests. It is possible to involve them in the process by taking their perspective on board as a valuable body of knowledge. This helps identify key actors to involve in the process. Their perspective inspires the design of valuable solutions.
