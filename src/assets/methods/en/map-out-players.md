### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Innovation processes require a group effort. There are people inside and outside the organization who can enable, support, or hinder this effort. One important step in terms of preparation is mapping out the players. Their motivation, legitimacy, capability and competence to get involved are assessed in order to channel their energy as potential in the process.

### Added value

This can be used to derive strategies for sound collaboration:

- Who are we going to collaborate with in the innovation process, when will this happen and how?

- Who needs to be informed and in how much detail? If necessary, who needs to make decisions?

- Who can be consulted on crucial points or in the event of critical queries?

In this way, it is possible to identify and specifically address additional individuals for the core team, experts for workshops and partners for investigation in the field.
