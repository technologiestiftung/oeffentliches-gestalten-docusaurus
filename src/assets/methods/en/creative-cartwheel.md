### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Creative cartwheeling involves alternating positive and negative thinking. The method is based on the principle of collective authorship. By always referring to the ideas of other team members, a collection of ideas is created that no single individual could have come up with on their own.

### Added value

When an idea is passed from one person to the next, it can grow and change in unexpected ways. If we alternately stretch our imagination by means of exuberant approval and devastating criticism, amazing and original solutions emerge. Even if the individual ideas seem weird or impossible, the core often includes conceptual signposts that point in a promising direction.
