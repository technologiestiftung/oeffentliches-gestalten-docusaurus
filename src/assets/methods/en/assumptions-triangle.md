note: "It is rarely the case that our behavior and the way we reach conclusions is based on facts alone. Nobel laureate D. Kahneman identifies two strategies for dealing with the modern world: fast thinking, which is constantly in active mode and involves making rapid, automatic judgments, and slow thinking, which is exhausting, consumes energy, and is activated only when something complex or unexpected arises within the stream of fast thinking."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Assumptions Triangle** helps separate facts from bias and assumptions. This can reveal any conscious or unconscious bias regarding the problem. As a result, it is possible to harness existing prejudices that are rarely talked about so as to gain a better understanding of the problem.

### Added value

Assumptions can be sensitively and accurately verified through contact with key actors. They provide the basis for later observations or an **interview guide**.
