note: "The exploratory focus forms the basis for investigation in the field. So-called grounded theory (Glaser in Walsh, Holton et al. 2015) is based on detecting patterns in behavior, data, and theories. By incorporating the perspectives of key actors, patterns can be deciphered, enabling fresh evidence and theories to be derived."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Focusing on knowledge gaps that require further investigation and pursuing unconfirmed assumptions is one of the most important requirements in terms of legitimizing the departure from a familiar environment. All questions in the template have to be answered in order to communicate clearly and simply why key actor participation is necessary.

### Added value

In addition to looking back at what has been accomplished, it shows what is planned next. This will enable team members and managers who are committed to moving away from existing routines to successfully communicate to their next level of management why the venture should continue to be supported.
