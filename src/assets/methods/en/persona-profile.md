### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

**Persona Profiles** describe fictional characters. Each one usually represents a group of people, such as our key actors, with their shared interests, behavioral patterns, or demographic similarities. They’re initially based on aggregate assumptions that are enriched and substantiated with insights from the investigation.

### Added value

Different key groups of actors have different needs, experiences, and expectations that can be empathetically highlighted through Persona Profiles. Profiles of extreme or marginal actors support the development of solution concepts that are of value to a wide range of users.
