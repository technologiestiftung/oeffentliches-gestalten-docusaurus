### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

New questions and possibly doubts are bound to emerge during the inquiry process, in addition to the knowledge collected. During mapping, it is important not to neglect any knowledge gaps but to actively engage with these so as to identify concrete areas of potential. In this way, both knowledge and knowledge gaps can be integrated precisely into the ongoing process.

### Added value

By using this 2x2 matrix, we acknowledge that we’re operating in a complex environment. The blind spots we uncover form the basis for further exploration: we can draw on these to solve the problem. We can see what is most relevant moving forward. As a team, we start talking not just about similar things, but about the same things.
