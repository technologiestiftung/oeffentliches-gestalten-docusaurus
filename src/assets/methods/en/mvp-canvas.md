### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

This canvas enables us to develop the foundations of a _Minimal Viable Product/Process_. This is the version of our product or process that validates the value of our solution for selected users with the least possible effort. The MVP approach is based on the principle of creating a product or process as quickly as possible and equipping it only with the basic functions.

### Added value

MVPs are essential to minimize risk factors in the course of the further development process. By creating and testing only a rough, low-cost version first, more elaborate features and functions can be developed incrementally.
