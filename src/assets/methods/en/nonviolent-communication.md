### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The Four-Step Model of Nonviolent Communication helps people in intense work-related contexts or day-to-day situations resolve conflicts instead of trying to win them.

The following routines should be avoided:

- **Analysis:** This is wrong because ...
- **Criticism:** Your mistake was that ...
- **Interpretation:** You do this because ...
- **Judgment:** You are ...
- **Threat:** If you don’t do this, then ...

These reinforce a bad atmosphere by not directly addressing hidden desires.

### Added value

This kind of communication enables routines to be turned upside down without apportioning blame. Instead of putting the blame on the other person, you take responsibility for improving the situation yourself in a constructive and appreciative way.
