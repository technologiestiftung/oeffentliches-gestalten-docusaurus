### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

It is common practice to draw up a project plan including a brief presentation, objectives, work input and anticipated outcomes. The **Development Plan** additionally includes the most important outcomes of the preparation phase such as the [Process Flow](/en/buch/vorbereiten/prozess-planen#process-flow) and the [Team Profile](/en/buch/vorbereiten/beteiligte-identifizieren-analysieren#team-profile--self-assessment).

### Added value
