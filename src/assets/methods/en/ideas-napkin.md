note: "The D’Artagnan model by S. Fischer describes ideas systematically. Ideas always have a starting point: An unsolved problem has been encountered or an unmet challenge has been identified. The solution is what is newly introduced, often understood as an idea. The value describes the particular importance of the solution to those impacted by the idea."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Ideas Napkin** helps compile the outcomes of an intense work phase. It contains only the central elements of an idea. In clear and succinct form, it describes the challenge, its solution, and how it benefits one or more groups of actors.

### Added value

The brief description states what the team has agreed on as being the central elements of the idea. This brings the innovative quality of the idea to life and makes it easier to communicate. A digital napkin is useful for many ideas and can also form part of a larger database of ideas.
