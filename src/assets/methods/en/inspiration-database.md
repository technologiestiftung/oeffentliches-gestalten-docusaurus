### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The Inspiration Database is a systematic approach to organizing, archiving and retrieving inspirational examples relating to a specific area of potential. By assigning different categories such as focus, format, scope and target group, we can compare the concepts or practical examples that have been collected.

### Added value

The greater the interest in systemic innovation, the more it is possible to find. Even though the set-up can appear fairly labor-intensive, the database is a valuable contribution not only in terms of the present but also for future ventures. This also gives decision- makers an easy way to quickly look up something new.
