### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

By selecting key actors, we have theoretically narrowed down who appears to be important for our knowledge acquisition process. The next step is to compare this with reality. In preliminary talks, we can decide whether or not the personality behind the key actor really can help us. For this reason, in-person meetings are not simply scheduled: they are initiated individually based on contact made at the preliminary talks.

### Added value

**Preliminary talks** are important when it comes to selecting our interview partners based on relevance – and not according to their position in the organization or statistical metrics. Valuable interviews are voluntary and derive from a mutual interest in taking a closer look at a topic.
