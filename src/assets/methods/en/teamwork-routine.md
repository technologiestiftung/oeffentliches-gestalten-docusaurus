note: "Agility is a word that is on everyone’s lips in the public sector, too. Teamwork routines allow work meetings to be held on a self-organized basis and follow a clear structure. This lays the foundation for agile working. An open yet disciplined and collaborative approach is necessary in order to be able to deal with complex issues in a cooperative manner."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Teamwork Routine** helps structure the flow of work meetings, taking into account the organizational culture. As an agenda, it opens up a creative space within a very short time and closes it again in a way that is oriented towards results.

### Added value

This procedure is not only useful for team meetings: it can also be used in a modified form for other sessions – regardless of whether they last 30 minutes or 4 hours. The added value is to make the best possible use of the time available for the joint development of interim outcomes.
