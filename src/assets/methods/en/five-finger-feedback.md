note: "Interpersonal dialog and contact thrive on constant feedback. It is an often unconscious process that can be articulated and elucidated by means of various methods. With a little practice, this improves how people perceive themselves and are perceived by others. Feedback is not an evaluation of performance: it is used for individual and shared learning. Individual feedback methods are now very common in the evaluation of learning experiences. (Goetz, Reinhardt. 2016. Führung: Feedback auf Augenhöhe)"

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Five Finger Feedback** activity promotes quick and structured reflection. The method can be used at the end of workshops or meetings or to round off a day of team work.

### Added value

This multi-layered feedback enables experience to be integrated in the ongoing process as a lesson learned. Visual documentation creates transparency and shows that every opinion in the team is valued.
