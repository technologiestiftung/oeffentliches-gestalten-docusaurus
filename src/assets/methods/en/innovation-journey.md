note: "In addition to the Innovation Journey, experience can also be gained through so-called _innovation shadowing_. This involves being allowed to look over somebody’s shoulder for a day, for example, so as to gain insights into their innovation work. By accompanying key individuals to simply observe and collect impressions, it is possible to gain inspiration and also acquire knowledge before going on to reflect on this. (Stangl, 2020)."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Visiting innovative projects is the most direct way to find out about new things. The Innovation Journey promotes strategic exploration of tomorrow’s trends – whether in other countries or cities or just around the corner.

### Added value

By experiencing innovative and unfamiliar things on site and by entering into dialog with the people who have enabled them, we gain first-hand experience and a deeper understanding. In this way, we can reflect on what we have experienced and develop it further in our own organization.
