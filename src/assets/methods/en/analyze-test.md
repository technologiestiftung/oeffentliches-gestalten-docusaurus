### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The _3 x What_ reflection method enables us to
review a shared experience in a structured way.
This is accomplished by going through three stages: gathering facts _(What?)_, interpreting the facts and deriving conclusions _(So what?)_, and deciding on the next logical steps _(Now what?)_.


### Added value

Every voice is heard, allowing key insights and new directions to emerge. This joint approach prevents the kind of misunderstandings from arising that otherwise tend to fuel disagreement about what to do next.
