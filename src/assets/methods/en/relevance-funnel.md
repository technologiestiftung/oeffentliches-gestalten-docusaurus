### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

In order to draft an innovative solution, the areas
of potential developed are viewed from three perspectives and evaluated in three stages. In the funnel, areas of potential are selected step by step until an intersection is formed in the middle. These areas of potential reflect the highest level of relevance with regard to the question under investigation.

### Added value

The Relevance Funnel is a simple way of promoting multi-perspective thinking. The focus is on designing a solution that will continue to improve in the future for everyone involved.
