### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The Value Tower helps prioritize values associated with attitudes and positions underlying current action. The method creates clarity in terms of the development or analysis of ideas. It can be used in a variety of ways to reflect on experience, highlight value propositions, or engage in strategic planning.

### Added value

Personal assessment allows aspects that we take for granted to be discussed openly and objectively within the group. Jointly defined core values serve as a point of reference as the process moves forward. They facilitate development and communication of the innovative solution.
