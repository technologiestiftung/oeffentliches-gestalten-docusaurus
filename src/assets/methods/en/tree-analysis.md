### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Tree Analysis** promotes consideration of the context of a problem based on an examination of the root causes of a challenge and identification of the relevant effects. Using this information it is possible to set the focus for further elaboration more precisely, laying the foundation for a targeted inquiry.

### Added value

The field of vision is expanded in relation to the problem. Different points of view and concerns can be collected in a factual manner and effectively sorted by the team. This process helps visualize patterns or dependencies, thereby enabling a systematic approach to tackling the problem.
