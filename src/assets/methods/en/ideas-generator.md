### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Ideas Generator** involves a problem or issue being viewed from different perspectives. Nine provocative approaches are used to develop ideas or create entirely new ones. This enables a large number of surprising notions to be formulated and considered quickly and comprehensively.

### Added value

The **Ideas Generator** extends the thinking around a concept in different directions. This creates the basis for stimulating discussions that strengthen the solution. To use the tool effectively, the starting point (a concept from the [Creative Cartwheel](/en/buch/entwerfen/viele-ideen-entwickeln#creative-cartwheel), problem or suggestion) should be clearly presented.
