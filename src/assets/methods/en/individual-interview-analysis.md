note: "Instead of proving hypotheses or trying to project an image of a social domain, the aim is to stick close to the reality of the key actors. This is important if we are to develop a solution that is genuinely relevant to the real-life situation and contributes to improving it. Practice in the field of so-called synthesis is constantly evolving: there are countless ways of reporting on and collectively interpreting the experiences narrated by key actors."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Analyzing information involves teamwork: the aim is to make the wealth of existing qualitative data manageable and usable. Key aspects are elaborated for each individual interview.

### Added value

The framework for feeding in the content from the interviews is flexibly adaptable. All team members are invited to fill it in: this ensures that the focus is not just on the obvious but also on underlying insights that might not otherwise be identified.
