note: "The mistake is often made of designing a solution that is based too much on the project team’s assumptions. Ultimately, however, the deciding factor will be what is important to future users. So before we design the prototype, we start by defining who the test subjects will be."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The test base provides the foundation for creating a prototype and testing it. This overview contains all the necessary information required here: from the key data required to develop the prototype through to details of how to organize the test situation.

### Added value

All knowledge and task packages are presented coherently at a glance. This creates a communication basis for involving test subjects, reporting to managers or delegating tasks within the team.

The test basis can be used to summarize the limited amount of resources required to test an idea with a view to its value.
