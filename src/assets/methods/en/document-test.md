note: "In the case of multiple test situations, it is advisable to meet as a team immediately after each test run and reflect on the experience. As an addition to the documentation drawn up during the test – which is fundamental for the overall analysis – an ad hoc assessment allows spontaneous adjustments to be made to the prototype or the test situation, thereby accelerating the learning process."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The test situation and application of the prototype is documented using a simple matrix.

Documentation is based on specific observation points and original quotes. It should be carried out in a focused manner for each test subject throughout the entire course of the test.

### Added value
After the test, the documentation is jointly reviewed by a team. In addition to the test questions, users’ body language and interactions can also provide relevant insights into the functionality of the solution. The insights are condensed in the template [Analyze Test](/en/buch/erproben/lernen-anpassen#analyze-test).
