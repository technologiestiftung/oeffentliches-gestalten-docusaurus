note: "Innovation processes involve parallel communication and coordination. Numerous work steps are required in the different phases, some of which overlap in time. This means that one step often can’t be completed before another begins. For this reason, planning must take account of both internally oriented and externally oriented work."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The **Process Flow** allows all participants to see the time frame of the project at a glance: what is to be done at what stage of the venture? This is less about pinpoint planning and more about sketching things out as a rough draft.

### Added value

A schematic overview illustrates the scope of the different phases within the overall process. In addition to the participation formats, the work that goes into them is shown, too. The overview can be used in communication with managers to obtain appropriate support. In addition, it serves to shape the collaboration with team members as well as other internal and external stakeholders. The **Process Flow** becomes a living document that provides orientation and a basis for evaluation as the venture moves forward.
