### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Warm-ups are brief sessions lasting 5 to 15 minutes maximum that playfully help teams adopt specific work attitudes. Creativity warm-ups are especially appropriate before generating new ideas because they encourage the production of wild and crazy thoughts. This way, the team can prepare to turn off their inner censor and build courage for extraordinary ideas.

### Added value

Creativity warm-ups break down barriers, foster empathy and weld teams together. They are easy to implement and can be used in almost any room situation for a wide variety of work formats. They encourage out-of-the-box thinking in teams, because each individual’s imagination is stimulated and the body is also activated in the process.
