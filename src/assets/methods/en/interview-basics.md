### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

In order to skillfully conduct interviews with key actors, a dress rehearsal should be held using the **Interview Guide**. This trial run aims to simulate the interview situation with a key actor. This is how we know if we’re asking the right questions and if our approach is working within the given setting.

### Added value

We can experience the situation for ourselves before the interview takes place. The rehearsal hones our perception and allows adjustments to be made to the Interview Guide. Once we’ve been through the interview situation ourselves, we’re ready to engage with the actual person we’re going to meet.
