    content: "Make prototypes in day-to-day work to communicate your ideas more clearly."
note: "Studies on user experience show that changes in the product development process in the early stages are about 100 times more beneficial than changes made at later stages. Prototyping is particularly relevant to public administration when it comes to promoting targeted developments that are funded with public money."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

Concept Prototypes enable simple and cost-effective implementation of the core idea to be validated. This can be a visualized process, a simple drawing, or even a physically tangible object such as a paper prototype.

### Added value

This allows the solution to be experienced at first hand. By having actors interact with the prototype in a usage context, problems can be identified early on and be fixed before money is spent on implementation. In addition, this approach often reveals aspects of the idea that were previously unknown or had not been thought of. As a result, valuable information can be collected on how to refine the idea and add what was previously lacking.
