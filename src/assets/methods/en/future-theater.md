note: "The Future Theater is based on Improv Prototyping by Liberating Structures. Here, three levels of knowledge are tapped into simultaneously: explicit knowledge shared by participants; tacit knowledge discovered by observing other participants’ performance; and emerging knowledge, i.e. new ideas that emerge and are developed collaboratively. This powerful combination is a seriously fun exercise and can be the source of transformative experiences."

### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The Future Theater gives participants the opportunity to put themselves in a desirable situation in the future. A situation is presented in which the problem no longer exists after application of the solution.
This enables both the performers and the audience to experience what the innovation feels like.

### Added value

Rather than getting bogged down in discussion about the innovative solution, it is possible to experience what feels right or wrong about it at first hand using all your senses. By stopping or freezing individual scenes, participants can be specifically questioned about aspects of their role.
