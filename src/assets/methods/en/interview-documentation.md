### What is it and what purpose does it serve?

The interview documentation is a transcript based on original quotes and observations. It enables us to undertake a joint analysis afterwards which takes in body language and interactions with the physical setting in addition to the actual subject of the interview.

### Added value

By documenting the situation before, during and after the interview, we can discover aspects that are often overlooked. Information that seems unimportant becomes relevant when viewed in context. In addition, experience has shown that visualizations are always enriching!
