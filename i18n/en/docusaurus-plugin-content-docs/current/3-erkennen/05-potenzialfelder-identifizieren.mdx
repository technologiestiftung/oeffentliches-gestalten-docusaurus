# Identify areas of potential

## Present areas of potential

After formulating several questions that point us in the direction of an appropriate solution, we illustrate what development opportunities this presents.

By describing areas of potential, we are summarizing the relevant interim outcomes of this phase, as well as revealing untapped opportunities and possible risks relating to the issue. Based on the [Area-of-Potential Profile](#area-of-potential-profile), it is possible to derive concrete recommendations as well as measures that can be implemented right away. In turn, this allows our organization to invest energy and resources in solutions that have a positive impact, not only for key actors but also for the organization itself.

The presentation of the interim outcomes from the phases of exploration and discovery is an important milestone in the overall process. In doing this, we are aware we may be presenting outcomes that are outside the familiar framework of thought and action.

After the presentation, our players, allies, partners, colleagues, and managers will tell us about how they feel about our venture and what, if anything, they can contribute to its further development. We take their feedback on board with a sense of curiosity and condense it into suggestions that we consider in the course of further development.

## Checklist: Presentation

The presentation of interim outcomes is successful if we:

### Procedure

1. Have previous interim outcomes and material ready. Use the template as a structure for creating presentation slides.

2. Start from the [HCW questions](/en/buch/erkennen/potenziale-eingrenzen#how-can-we--questions). Sift through all of them and group similar questions. Use one profile per group. Enter appropriate **HCW questions** as a starting point.

3. What are the insights and data on which the **HCW questions** are based?
Enter the most striking aspects in terms of desirable states, hindering factors, and associated evidence. If useful principles have been identified, note these down as well.

4. Review previous profile entries for topic priorities, specific problems, and promising options. Briefly describe the topic, problem, and option in context. Come up with a catchy working title; use metaphors and visual language for support. Number the area of potential.

5. Finally, consider what concrete recommendations result from this, as well as measures that can be implemented right away. Use the [Development Matrix](/en/buch/vorbereiten/ist-zustand-betrachten#development-matrix) for support.

6. In order to process more **HCW questions**, repeat steps **2** to **5**.

7. Prepare presentation in an appealing way that is tailored to the target group. Look at all of the potential profiles and consider what might generate the most interest. Start with this.
