# Formulate insights

## Filter relevant information

A lot of information is amassed in the course of several interviews lasting 45 â€“ 60 minutes. After all team members have spoken to various key actors, we structure our insights using the [Individual Interview Analysis](#individual-interview-analysis).

### Indicate frictions

Our interview documentation contains qualitative data that reflects diverse and possibly irrational behavior. Key insights are often to be found among the experiences, perceptions and impressions described by our interview partners. Statements that are surprising, emotional or contradictory in relation to the problem will be especially relevant to our search for solutions.

### Understand motivations

Our analysis is based on the search for the causes of certain attitudes, feelings or behavioral patterns. Why do our key actors perceive some- thing the way they do? Only by understanding the motivations behind actions can we identify approaches to change. These insights will be the key to actual innovation.

Analyzing and interpreting overarching core aspects is a group effort, which is why we share the most interesting outcomes of the individual analyses as a team and continue to work on these together.

### Discover overlaps

The insights gained from the individual interviews are differentiated into desirable and hindering aspects using the [Need-Obstacle Filter](#need-obstacle-filter). Within these fields, similar aspects gain importance and patterns emerge based on groupings. From this collection of needs and obstacles, pairs can be combined that are mutually dependent, providing a guiding context of meaning for our venture.

### Ensure plausibility

In order to maintain an overview during this phase, the data that has been collected needs to be consistently labeled. A cogent system of abbreviations should be used that is applied stringently so as to ensure verifiability for decision-makers as well as guaranteeing the link to the key actors in the further course of the process. Finally, we can use the [Misconception Check](#misconception-check) to detect biased conclusions and avoid follow-up errors.

### Procedure

1. Have all the information relating to an interview to hand.Write down one quote or aspect per sticky note. Select key statements and observations that seem particularly surprising, emotional or contradictory:

- What were particularly positive or negative perceptions?
- What were motivating or obstructive elements?
- What conflicts or dependencies are there?
- What interests and goals are there?
- What are the fears or other factors that limit behavior?

2. Transfer the template into a large format for each individual interview. Talk briefly and concisely about what is written on the sticky notes. Intuitively stick a piece of paper next to one of the four fields in the outer part of the template (_Parking Space_).

3. Once all the sticky notes have been gathered in the Parking Space, look for patterns. Discuss as a team which slips of paper belong together and cluster similar aspects in the inner part of the fields. Condense individual slips of paper into areas to indicate a link between their content.

4. Summarize the content of intersections in your own words and write down on new sticky notes. These are the insights we have gained for ourselves. Write the actor abbreviation on each one and add the initial letter of the field (M, L, F, G).
Stick these slips of paper in the central circle.

5. Document everything and keep the key insights from the individual interviews in order to continue working with them in the _Need-Obstacle Filter_.

### Procedure

1. Transfer template into a large format. Collect all insights from the [individual interview analyses](#individual-interview-analysis) in the _Parking Space_.

2. Sift through individual aspects and differentiate them into needs and obstacles based on the stimulus questions. Classify the key actors according to **Field A, B, C** or **D**.

3. Condense insights. To do this, start in Field A with the needs of those who are impacted. Search for similar aspects and group them together. What is the common denominator? Formulate the core aspect in your own words. Write this down on a sticky note. Note source by adding the relevant abbreviation and put it in the inner section of the field. Tip: Use the [Misconception Check](#misconception-check) to verify consistency and adapt as needed.

4. Repeat Step **3** for **Field B**.

5. Consider core aspects from **Field A** and **Field B** together and look for combinations. Which need most closely matches which obstacle? There will be several pairings that fit. What causes the most difficulties? Agree on the 1-3 most relevant pairs and place them in the middle.

6. Repeat Steps **3 - 5** for **Field C** and **Field D**.

7. Document outcomes. Keep need-obstacle pairs carefully as interim outcomes. These will be needed for further work with the [Potential Construction Kit](/en/buch/erkennen/potenziale-eingrenzen#potential-construction-kit).

<Hint>
  <b>Note:</b> Some insights may not fit into a pairing: these are indicative of further investigative questions.
