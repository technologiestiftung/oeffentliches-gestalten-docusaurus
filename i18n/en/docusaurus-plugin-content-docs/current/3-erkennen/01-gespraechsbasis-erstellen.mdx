# Establish a basis for dialog

## Prepare interview structure

Finally the time has come! The heart of our discovery process lies before us: after all the intensive preparatory work carried out by our team, it’s now time to dive into the perspective of the key actors – both those impacted and those responsible.

### Examine assumptions

We completed the exploration phase by gathering knowledge and defining our assumptions about the problem. In order to deepen this knowledge and challenge our assumptions, we will now develop an [Interview Guide](#interview-guide) that allows us to engage in open dialog with those who are particularly linked to the effects and causes of the problem under consideration.

There are many qualitative methods for reaching out to people – interviews, focus groups, participant observation and video analysis, for example. In the steps that follow, we will focus on interviews and on-site observations: this is an approach that involves personal encounter, which generates added value for everyone involved. If we prepare the interview structure in advance, it’s easier to evaluate the interviews from a qualitative point of view.

### Listen and observe

Every good dialog has a dramaturgy that builds the trust required to share experience and possibly even engage in unconscious communication. For this reason, the **Interview Guide** is based on a small number of open questions. The questions contain points of reference such as difficulties, behavior and attitudes that are to be discussed with all interview partners. These questions seek to find out about personal stories relating to relevant experiences.

### Incorporate the physical setting

By engaging in dialog, we are able to empathize as far as possible with the perspective of our opposite number. But this works even more effectively if we go to the place where the problem actually occurs – whether at the workplace, at a street crossing or in a public building. When we experience the problem in the day-to-day context of our key actors, we may notice other things we hadn’t previously considered. So in our [Interview Basics](#interview-basics), we don’t just note down what is said but also what we observe about the setting as a whole. This sharpens our perception and helps depict the situation holistically based on key points.

### Procedure

1. Transfer template to a larger piece of paper.

2. Have the outcomes of the [Situation Report](/en/buch/erkunden/untersuchungsfokus-setzen#situation-report), [Assumptions Triangle](/en/buch/erkunden/annahmen-hinterfragen#assumptions-triangle) and [Knowledge Atlas](/en/buch/erkunden/blinde-flecken-aufdecken#knowledge-atlas) at hand. Transfer relevant aspects to the structure level and adapt if necessary.

3. Using bullet points and examples along the arc, develop simple open- ended questions that allow for unique and surprising answers.

- General questions address ideas and points of view on the
subject.

- Experiential questions focus on positive, negative, and surprising experiences.

- Follow-up questions enable us to pursue a specific experiential question in greater detail and find out more about particular aspects or contradictions. Alternate between experiential questions and follow-up questions.

- The interview is concluded with wish questions. The wish scenarios described often provide input regarding additional goals.

- Come to a conclusion and request a personal summary of the most important aspects.

4. Write down questions from each category for your venture.

<Hint>
  <b>Note:</b> Different interview guides can be created for impacted and responsible key actors. It may also be worthwhile adapting the guide within the group of actors.

### Procedure

1. Form a test group with three people. Allocate roles. Two persons form a tandem to lead the discussion as the questioner and the record-keeper. Another takes on the role of the potential key actor.

- The questioner uses the [Interview Guide](#interview-guide) and interview tips in the template. In contrast to a work discussion in which two experts exchange views on a topic, the questioner acts rather like a reporter. Make use of the interview tips. Show genuine interest so as to help the other person articulate their perspective.

- Record-keeper uses [Transcript Template](#interview-basics) to note down key points, if possible in quotations, and records impressions of the physical setting on a separate sheet.

- Potential key actor answers the questions asked to the best of their ability.

2. Find a setting that is as close to the real thing as possible. Take in the physical situation and the setting with all senses. Note down key impressions.

3. Carry out a test run. Afterwards, use the [Interview Documentation](/en/buch/erkennen/rausgehen-menschen-treffen#interview-documentation) method to carry out an initial analysis.

4. Reflect on the test as a team: How did it feel? Was there a pleasant interview atmosphere? Did the questions and the procedure work? Adapt **Interview Guide** and scheduled times as needed.
