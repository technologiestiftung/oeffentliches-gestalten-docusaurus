## Conclude the preparation phase

### Things to celebrate:

During the preparation phase, at least one person initiated the process, assembled a team, laid the groundwork for an innovative, exploratory process, and got the green light from management.

### Things that might have been strenuous:

Innovation processes have the potential to put familiar patterns of collaboration to the test. This can lead to difficulties and tensions that not only have a personal impact but can also affect various aspects of the organization such as the handling of responsibilities and communication channels.

### Things that can be helpful in dealing with the above:

- Collaborate using a methods-based approach when working together in a regular setting, too 
- Communicate openly and address problems in an appreciative manner
- Get to the bottom of the problem
- Stay the course as a team
- Incorporate surprises in the process
