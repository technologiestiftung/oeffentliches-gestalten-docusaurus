# Start the venture

## Involve the management level

Innovation processes often don’t fit into classic hierarchical patterns. In order to be successful, they require intrinsically motivated allies at all levels of the organization.

It should be possible to create innovations at various different points. A lot can be achieved through personal initiative. However, numerous examples show that the efficiency and effectiveness of innovation projects depend to a large extent on the support of the (highest) levels of management. The [Development Plan](#development-plan) provides a very good basis for familiarizing management with the venture so as to secure the latter’s involvement in it.

### Connect and communicate skillfully

You know your superiors best. What is most likely to convince them: initial visible outcomes, a good pitch or joint planning?

Solid proposals regarding outlay and team composition are a good basis for making an appointment with your superiors. Demonstrate why the venture ought to receive support and resources. Put together arguments that clearly show what added value it will have for management and for your organization as a whole.

### Procedure

1. Answer all the questions on the template to bring together the essential points of the previous steps. Now it is possible to actively tackle the communication of the venture.

2. A successful presentation is prepared to suit the specific addressee and their needs. The ABC questions can be used for this purpose:

  **1 Attitude:** What is the recipient’s attitude?

  **2 Background:** What general conditions are of importance to the recipient(s)?

  **3 Concern:** What is the recipient most interested in?

3. Structure the presentation such that a decision can be made at the end if necessary. What is the minimum goal of the presentation? Communicate information, inspire participation, initiate subsequent action. A concrete goal promotes focused preparation of the presentation.

4. Underpin arguments for thes venture based on existing documentation. Are there reports or calculations that it is possible to build on? What other benefits does the venture offer?

5. Stories are more memorable than pure information. Try out the storyline of the presentation and test it on colleagues. The more convincingly you get to the point, the better people will respond.
