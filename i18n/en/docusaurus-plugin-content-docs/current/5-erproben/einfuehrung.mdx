# Dare to experiment

Our approach to innovation aims to design solutions that contribute to perceptible, positive change in the context of our key actors. In the test phase, our idea takes on its initial form. By giving the solution a tangible dimension, we can test it while at the same time refining our understanding as a team for the purpose of further development.

A prototype can be used to find out what the innovation feels like and what it does or does not improve. Prototypes are tools for interacting with stakeholders at the earliest stage of a solution to find out what is valuable and what may need to be changed. Experimenting in real-world contexts opens up additional perspectives that are only partially foreseeable when an idea is first conceived.

Test formats are diverse and can involve a wide variety of elements and dimensions in public administration, such as forms, digital processes or even regulatory experiments. In the case of far-reaching changes, pilot tests are required that allow systemic consequences to be observed and scaling to be modeled based on data. This handbook guides us through up to the conception of a Minimal Viable Process or Product (MVP), ensuring we are ideally equipped for further implementation steps.

We can’t wait to see what works in reality! If we want to produce results that contribute to solving the problem, we have to be willing to give space to our idea rather than holding on to it too tightly.

## Phase objective and stages

In the test phase, we become aware of the added value of test formats and rapid learning cycles. We develop prototypes to turn our idea into an experience that can be tried out on key actors. **Testing gives us the inspiration to adapt and refine our idea that we wouldn’t have been able to come up with on our own.** We analyze these suggestions and draw on the insights gained in the test as a basis for designing an MVP.
