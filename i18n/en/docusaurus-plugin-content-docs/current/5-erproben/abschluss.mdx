## Conclude the test phase

### Things to celebrate:

In the test phase, our solution emerged as a visible and tangible prototype. We were able to watch how the test subjects got to grips with the solution we had in mind in an initial test run. During this process, we found out what is important to and valued by the people we’re doing this for. We had fun creating personas, and they will stay with us beyond the process.

### Things that might have been strenuous:

We’re proud of the prototype we developed, so it was difficult not to praise it in the test or defend it in the aftermath. Sobering feedback has not left us indifferent. Surprisingly, having our assumptions refuted has noticeably refined the core of the solution.

### Things that can be helpful in dealing with the above:

- Critical feedback is a valuable treasure for further development

- Rather than seeking to justify ourselves, we should question criticism positively and be aware of the opportunities it offers

- Encourage test subjects to describe their experience with the prototype using all their senses
