# Stay in contact

Congratulations, you have acquired fundamental knowledge on how to design innovation processes. We hope you learned at least as much by reading this book as we did by writing it.

We have incorporated our extensive experience in the field of public innovation into this handbook with the aim of making a practical contribution to sustainable and digital administrative practice for the state of Berlin and beyond. We hope you didn’t get discouraged by the trial and error process – innovation processes are fragile and challenging. Keep trying again and again. The public administration of the future is emerging now! Share your experience generously and support each other.

We’d like to meet you, too. Some questions have probably been resolved by trying out the ideas in the book. But new ones will certainly have arisen as well. We want to hear all about it. Maybe you work in administration and want to launch an innovative project with us?\
Or perhaps you have an idea about what can be done better.

Get in touch with us – we look forward to hearing from you!

**CityLAB Berlin & Politics for Tomorrow**

<hr className="block h-px bg-grey-100 w-1/4 !my-8" />

_CityLAB is Berlin’s public innovation laboratory at the former Tempelhof Airport. Together with the Berlin administration and numerous partners from urban society, we develop projects and prototypes to shape the future of urban living. CityLAB combines elements of a digital workshop, co-working, event space and interactive exhibition to create a place where innovation and participation are conceptually combined._

_Politics for Tomorrow is a non-partisan initiative that advocates for the people-oriented and values-centered design of public systems. We have been working with political and administrative institutions from the local to the highest federal level in Germany and internationally since 2015. Our focus is on building competencies for and with people in politics and administration in order to promote an empathetic, innovative and forward-looking approach throughout the entire policy cycle – whether in defining initial situations, developing strategies and scenarios or designing and testing new services._
