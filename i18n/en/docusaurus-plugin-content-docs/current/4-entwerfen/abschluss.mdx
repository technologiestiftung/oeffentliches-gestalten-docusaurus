## Conclude the design phase

### Things to celebrate:

The _design phase_ was a joy! Taking pleasure in our work, we’ve succeeded in breaking out of habitual thought patterns and inspiring others to strike out on a new path. We’ve gained experience of innovative projects and drawn inspiration from them. It may have surprised us to see how initial ideas for solutions change when we look at them through the eyes of future generations.

### Things that might have been strenuous:

We’re used to underpinning our arguments with hard evidence and contributing our expertise in a factually based manner. A well-rehearsed approach of this kind may have made the start of this phase more difficult. It is precisely by means of creative processes that thoughts conceived of by individuals merge into a single idea produced by a group. Only through collaboration can this be cultivated into a viable solution. This creative process can be turbulent because it requires us to step out of our comfort zone.

### Things that can be helpful in dealing with the above:

- Give yourself and the team the chance to digest impressions in a familiar setting

- Ensure that breaks from creative thinking are deliberately scheduled into the process

- Use [Creative Aikido](/en/buch/entwerfen/viele-ideen-entwickeln#creative-cartwheel) on a routine basis
