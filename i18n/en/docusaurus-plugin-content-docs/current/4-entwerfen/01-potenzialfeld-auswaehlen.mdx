# Select area of potential

## Filter out the most promising potential

In the previous phases, we identified different [areas of potential](/en/buch/erkennen/potenzialfelder-identifizieren#potential-profile). Since we canâ€™t work on all of these at once, we now focus on a few areas of potential or a single one. Extensive areas of potential that require collaboration with other departments have to be tackled with the necessary planning and using the appropriate additional resources.

### Filter areas of potential according to relevance
We will place our focus on an area of potential that we can continue to work on independently as a team and where it is likely that development of a successful solution is possible. Feedback from the presentation in the last phase will be an important indicator when it comes to assessing this.

When selecting the area of potential using the [Relevance Funnel](#relevance-funnel) method, we must bear in mind that a key systemic improve- ment is only achieved if a large number of people benefit from it. This applies both to the key actors and to our organization as a whole. In order to come up with solutions that go beyond the current horizon of our experience, we will take care to include the perspective of future generations.

### Procedure

1. Transfer template into a large format and place on a table that is easily accessible from all sides. Have sticky notes and several pens ready in Fields **A, B**, and **C**.

2. Review all [areas of potential](/en/buch/erkennen/potenzialfelder-identifizieren#potential-profile) and the feedback from presentation participants and assign these to Fields **A, B** and **C**. Use the following stimulus question when sorting: Which of the potential areas and feedback points are
**A:** important to all key actors, **B:** particularly relevant to our organization, or **C:** worth striving for with a view to future generations?

3. Each tandem decides on a **Perspective A, B** or **C** and adopts this for further processing.

4. Each tandem:

- answers the first question in their field (5 min).
- decides on three areas of potential.
- presents the decisions to the others, briefly giving reasons (3 min each).
- provides room for discussion and adapts selection if necessary.

5. Repeat Step **4** for the second and third questions in the fields.

6. As a team, look at the intersection at the core and work together to select the most relevant area of potential or combination. In the case of a combination, a reformulated [HCW question](/en/buch/erkennen/potenziale-eingrenzen#how-can-we--questions) may be required.

<Hint>
  <b>Note:</b> Ideally, three tandems (consisting of two people each) should carry out this method.
