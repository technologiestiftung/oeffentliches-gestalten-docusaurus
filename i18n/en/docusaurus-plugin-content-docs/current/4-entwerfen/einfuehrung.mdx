# Arrival in the solution area

As we move on from Discover to Design, we leave the problem area and immerse ourselves in the solution area. Based on the potential identified, we will now set about systematically developing ideas. In order to arrive at solution concepts that are innovative and relevant to our venture, the key actors will remain at the center of our work.

A creative approach is essential in the development of public innovations. Here we draw a fundamental distinction between creativity of ideas and artistic creativity. Creativity of ideas does not depend on talent: it’s something that can be acquired by everyone.

Through the use of imaginative, visual, and expressive techniques, we can train our brains in areas of thinking that are essential to the development of innovation.

Being creative means thinking and doing new things. For this purpose, we have to leave our familiar environment and go out in search of ideas and solutions with a sense of curiosity. Our collective intelligence and imagination as a team can be set ablaze by external stimuli!

Designing things is fun – but it involves work, too. It means being prepared to improve on valuable ideas by means of constant adjustments and in certain circumstances letting go of ideas we’ve grown fond of.

In this phase, the kind of crazy ideas that would lead you into previously unimaginable areas and which would ordinarily be quickly discarded in your day-to-day work are exactly the types of ideas we want to encourage here!

## Phase objective and stages

In the design phase, we allow new things to emerge. Drawing on inspiration from those around us, dialog with experts and creative techniques, we collect a variety of approaches to solutions in response to the areas of potential elaborated previously. **From this diverse collection we select the most valuable ideas and pursue the concepts in greater depth. The goal of this phase is not to arrive a finished solution but to tease out the core of an idea.**
