# Develop multiple ideas

## Think and do the unusual

### Learn to think differently

Here, we don’t look at reality through just one pair of glasses, but through 10 or 20 pairs, one on top of the other: as we try to influence, replace or remove these, we address the provocation this perception produces.

Our conscious thinking is based on analysis and judgment. Many excellent techniques exist for understanding what exists, but there are very few aimed at deliberately creating something new. These stimulate the brain and break out of regular patterns of thinking. Thought processes that involve less conflict are important when it comes to acting efficiently, and familiarity is beneficial when reliable action is required. When it comes to engaging in a creative process, however, these are a hindrance. So: do the [Creativity Muscle Warm-Up](#creativity-muscle-warm-up).

Creative thinking – the ability to imagine something new – is needed as a core skill in public administration. It’s the only way to respond to new and complex challenges. This approach can be exhausting at times, but it results in pleasant surprises in the short term and produces creative and sustainable strategies in the long term.

### Here’s a brain teaser to get you in the mood:

How can the following nine points be connected with a maximum of four straight lines without putting down the pen? Feel free to try several times.

<div className="mx-auto w-3/4 aspect-square grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3">
  {Array.from(Array(9)).map((idx) => {
    return (
      <div key={idx} className="m-7 bg-blue-500 w-4 h-4 rounded-full"></div>
      )
})}

</div>

## Practice creativity

Creativity can be practiced – preferably with others. The art is to include different people’s perspectives even as you start out in search of a new idea. So at this stage, it’s essential to build on each other’s thoughts and develop these collaboratively. Using the Creative Cartwheel (p. 216) and the Ideas Generator (p. 220), you can come up with things
nobody could ever have thought of on their own.

### Procedure

1. Make targeted use of the warm-up methods **30 Circles** and **Creative Aikido**, e.g. just before developing ideas.

2. Put on the agenda and impose a time limit. Consider warm-up exercises in agenda planning and keep them short. The time constraint helps turn off the inner censor and allows the creative juices to flow freely.

3. Stay in the comfort zone. Choose warm-up exercises that create a good mood. Only when we feel good in ourselves can we be sure of a feelgood atmosphere in the group, too.

4. Create a safe atmosphere and have fun. There is no right or wrong with warm-ups. Lead by example and create a non-judgmental atmosphere.

5. Allow space for reflection. Warm-ups are not _games_. Finally, explain the purpose of each exercise to participants and invite them to engage in a brief reflection.

Two selected warm-ups show how the dormant creativity of a team can be awakened to promote collaborative thinking: **30 Circles** and **Creative Aikido**. These warm-up methods have proven particularly useful in developing ideas. Other options can be found on the internet, e.g. _66+1 Warm-Up Posters_.

  }
/>

### Procedure

1. Form teams of no more than five people standing or sitting around a table. Print out the template for each person or transfer to an A4 sheet. Work on Steps **2** to **6** in silence.

2. Together, choose a **“How Can We ...” question** or a problem and write it at the top of the sheet. To do this, each person individually considers an unconventional solution and writes it down in **Field A**. Pass the sheet clockwise to your neighbor. (5 min)

3. Read through the solution. Think about what nasty sabotage prevents this idea. Write down your thoughts in Field B. Pass the sheet clockwise to your neighbor. (5 min)

4. Read through solution and the sabotage. Consider how to deal with this proactively: find a way to implement the positive suggestion anyway. Write it down in **Field C**. Pass the sheet clockwise to your neighbor. (5 min)

5. Repeat Step **3** for **Field D**, repeat Step **4** for **Field E** and so on.

6. Last round: Read through all the solutions. Note down similarities in Fields A/C/E on sticky notes. Read through all the sabotages. Note down similarities in Fields B/D/F on sticky notes. (10 min)

7. Present and discuss the content of the sticky notes out loud in the group. Identify overarching points in common and write down the concept.

  }
/>

### Procedure

1. Have all materials ready and print out or copy one template per concept idea from the [Creative Cartwheel](#creative-cartwheel).

2. Enter core concept or solution in the upper left-hand corner of the sheet.

3. Consider what a _normal rule_ (default settings, operating mode, ...) might be for this concept. Write down assumptions. Start description with “The way this will work from now on is that ...”.

4. Select and apply a suggested provocation. Referring to the concept, consider the following: “How does it work now?”. Note down the new rule in the relevant line.

5. Provocation reveals a new aspect. Referring to the new rule, consider the following: “What consequences does this have for the idea? How might it need to be adapted?”. Note down the new aspect in the relevant line.

6. Repeat Step **4** and **5** for further selected provocations or all of them.

7. Sift through and review all new aspects. If necessary, use the [Visual Vote](/en/buch/entwerfen/idee-ausarbeiten#visual-vote) to prioritize.

8. Select best ideas. Write them down in the field at the top right so they can be used as the innovation process moves forward. Document outcomes.
