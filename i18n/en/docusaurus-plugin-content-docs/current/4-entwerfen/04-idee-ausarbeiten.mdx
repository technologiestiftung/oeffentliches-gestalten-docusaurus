# Elaborate an idea

## Select and try out ideas

The use of creative techniques has given rise to lots of great and perhaps unconventional ideas that have not yet been tested for feasibility. We can tease out the core of a solution using methods such as the [Visual Vote](#visual-vote) in combination with the [Value-Added-Effort Matrix](#value-added-effort-matrix).

### The format is not set until the end.

Once ideas have been developed and solutions formulated, it is tempting to plan their implementation directly based on milestones using an action-oriented approach. But it’s important to pause here first and familiarize ourselves better with the desired state we are trying to achieve. For this we need an open mind and a little patience. Instead of defining a specific format or medium for our solution, we start by using the **Future Theater** (LINK) to gain a better understanding of the benefits to our key actors, before we go on to define the functions of a product, for example. By using ourselves as a resonance space, we can get tangible access to the future without having to work out a concept or slide presentation.

Only once the target experience has clearly emerged do we consider what formats are available to the administration to enable this future experience to happen. In this way, the desirable experience projected for the future will be directly related to common options available for action by public administrators. Its impact may be to influence, reinforce or even change them.

### Legislative theater

By formulating stories, we come to realize what really matters. This type of methodological aid has already been put to successful use in administrative practice in isolated cases.

A new law came into force in Tyrol on July 1, 2018. The Participation Act regulates support to allow people with disabilities to participate in society. The project _Mach mit! Es geht um uns!_ (“Get involved! It’s about us!”) helped shaped the development of this law in a participatory and creative way. Forum theater was used as a method of political co-determination. In forum theater, the people concerned – i.e. the experts – point out difficulties and problems before getting together with the audience to look for potential improvements. The legislative context turned forum theater into legislative theater.

### Procedure

1. Write down all vote options on sticky notes and group them together or write them down as a list on a large piece of paper.

2. Communicate the subject of the vote. Remind participants of the purpose of the exercise before they cast their votes. Why is this vote being held and how will the result be used?

3. Establish rules for the vote together (see examples).

4. Announce the number of votes each participant has. Rule of thumb: The number of votes should be equivalent to about a quarter of the options to be voted on.

5. Votes are cast silently and simultaneously. During the voting process, it is important not to influence and lobby each other. There is no discussion until after votes have been cast.

6. Analyze the outcome. Then discuss the options with the most votes. Which focus areas can be identified? Who voted for certain options and why? Work together to create a ranking list.

**In case of a tie:** carry out another vote for the most popular options from the previous vote (max. 4) for the purpose of clarity. Repeat Steps **3 to 6** for this purpose. Or use [Value-Added-Effort Matrix](#value-added-effort-matrix).

  }
/>

### Procedure

1. Write down all voting options on individual sticky notes. A headline or keyword is sufficient for this purpose.

2. Present one idea at a time, sharing thoughts with the group and assessing them based on the following stimulus questions.

   **Added value for key actors:** How impressive is the idea? What added value does it create?

   **Work required in the organization:** How quickly or how easily can the idea be implemented? What effort is involved?

3. Place in the appropriate field, depending on suitability. Place all ideas in the matrix in turn.

4. Stimulate open discussion. Look at the distribution of ideas. What stands out? Where are there positive or negative surprises? Engage in group discussion about these ideas and where to place them. Make adjustments as necessary. Ideas that are not addressed in this step can be left in the selected field without comment.

5. Analyze the outcome. Look more closely at the ideas in the “YES!” field and select those aspects/ideas that the team agrees on most and is most committed to.

### Procedure

1. Visualize the solution developed up to this point and, as a team, imagine a situation in which the solution has been used successfully or has had an impact.

2. Define which key actors are important in this situation and assign their roles to people on the team. All participants take an active role.

3. Set up room and use props if necessary. Transfer documentation templates into a large format or copy them onto A4 sheets.

4. Consciously act out the role, ensuring you’re entirely in the moment:

- Briefly describe the scenario and the different roles (3 min).
- Play out the desired situation (3-5 min).
- Pause and reflect on **Column A & B**: first alone (2 min), then as a group (10-15 min). Where did you particularly sense an awkward crunch?

5. Act out crunch scene again and get the people involved in the situation to speak: What doesn’t feel right here? Why?
What would make it feel better? Why? Take the new, better element on board and experiment for a few minutes until a situation is found that everyone agrees with (10-15 min).

6. Conclude the role-play and reflect on **Column C & D**: first alone (2 min) and then as a group (10-15 min). Finally, note down the most important aspects for further development of the innovative solution.
