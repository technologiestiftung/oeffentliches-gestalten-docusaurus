## Conclude the exploration phase

### Things to celebrate

In the _exploration phase_ we became a team, building a shared picture of the challenge and identifying key actors. Based on this, we investigated existing knowledge to challenge related assumptions.

### Things that might have been strenuous:

Working without a hierarchy can give rise to uncertainties and problems. Giving honest and appreciative criticism is an art. This is one of the big challenges, especially when the teamwork initially gets going. To some extent, looking into existing data and facts throws up more questions than answers. This can lead to disorientation and doubt, which in turn impacts on motivation to continue searching.

### Things that can be helpful in dealing with the above:

- If there is a lack of knowledge, be bold to enough to admit it
- Refrain from blowing your own trumpet
- Draw on group intelligence to establish a focus
- Get out into the fresh air when energy levels are low
- Take breaks to relax
- Try out and rehearse new procedures
